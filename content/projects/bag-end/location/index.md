The Shire is a wide and pleasant land, situated in the North-West of Middle-earth. It is a land of peace and pastoral beauty, where the gentle hobbits dwell in their hobbit-holes, and the fields are full of ripe barley and wheat. The air is clean and the stars are bright, and the sound of the Shire's many streams and waterfalls can be heard on quiet nights.

It is a land where good food and good ale are always to be had, and where the simple pleasures of life are valued above all else.
