The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled walls, and tiled floors, and lots of electric lights, and big shiny doors at the far end.

The tunnel wound on and on, going
pleasantly uphill all the time, but not steeply. It had smooth walls, which looked like plaster, but they were actually made of the finest teak.

The floor was tiled in red and black, and the ceiling was arched and whitewashed, and had little portholes of thick glass letting in the light. Everything was beautifully clean and tidy, and decorated with such a profusion of flowers that it looked like a conservatory.

At intervals, doors opened on either side of the passage into rooms dug out of the soft earth, which was still visible in places. On the left-hand side, there were several large, airy, and well-lit rooms, filled with all sorts of furniture, for hobbits, unlike dwarves, have a passion for comfortable chairs and sofa cushions. There were deep armchairs covered in rich green velvet, and the walls and carpets were adorned with tapestries and pictures.

On the right-hand side, there were smaller rooms, some of which were plainly furnished for servants, and others filled with tools and strange devices. But they were all clean and dry and warm.
