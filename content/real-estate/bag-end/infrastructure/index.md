The road went on, and as it bent round the green skirts of the hill the hobbit could see that it had been well-tended. Grass banks smothered in flowers or vegetables sloped up to the walls of the houses. The houses themselves were built of whitewashed stone or of wood and brick, and their roofs were of tiles or thatch. There were windows in abundance, and on those that opened to the south woodbine was growing, while the flowers of jasmine and honeysuckle hung together in clusters in the windows of the houses that faced north. Down the hill the road ran, over a stone bridge, and passed through a hamlet built about a grey-green mill; and then it skirted a wood, high on the slopes to the right, that ran down to the deep-delved stream.
