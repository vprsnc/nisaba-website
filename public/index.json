Turkish Medical Tourism has three significant advantages: a low cost, high quality of care, and fast access to world-class treatment. Turkey\u0026rsquo;s main advantage is that it saves money when compared to other countries. The countries of Europe and the CIS recognize Turkey as their new health partner and center for medical tourism. Turkey offers quality and affordable medical travel packages for patients. The country perfectly combines treatment and thermal tourism, spas and wellness centers with five-star hotels. The cost of medical services in Turkey is 30-40% lower than in Europe, the USA or Israel. At the same time the quality of medical care remains at a high level. There are favorable service packages and convenient price offers. Package discounts are available for patients, which include everything except the ticket for a plane. Private, public and university hospitals, especially in Istanbul and Ankara, are equipped with modern diagnostic and treatment equipment. Many hospitals in Turkey provide high-tech medical services in the field of oncological treatment, cardiovascular surgery, orthopedics, neurosurgery, pediatric surgery, aesthetic, dental surgery, and microsurgery.\nMost often medical tourists go to Turkey for the treatment of cancer, bone marrow transplantation, organ transplantation, and microsurgical interventions. Plastic and aesthetic surgery is very popular among both women and men. The areas of neurosurgery, cardiology, dentistry, urology, obstetrics and gynecology, orthopedics and traumatology are no less in demand.\n","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/med-tourism/","section":"Medical Tourism","summary":"Turkey is one of the top ten destinations for medical tourism worldwide.","title":"Medical Tourism"},{"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
